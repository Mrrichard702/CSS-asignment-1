      <h2>Indigenous People of Treaty 5's Adhesion</h2>
      <p>
        The Goverment found new use for the northern Canadian region because of
        oil in the Mackenzie River area. The Goverment purposefully cut the
        benefits of <span>Treaties</span> as instead of making it a part of
        Treaty 10 which had better benefits then Treaty 5.In 1907 the First
        Nations People occupying the land of what would be The adhesion to
        Treaty 5 where the Cree bands living in the Nelson House and Split Lake.
        Later in 1908 the Indian Agent Reverend John Semmens Continued his
        objective of adding more First Nations People to Treaty 5. He was able
        to get signatures from 350 from mainly Cree bands such as Cross Lake,
        Fisher River, and Norway House. Some information about the adhesion's to
        certain <span>Treaties</span> was that those who weren't included in the
        previous version of the treaty would be joining that prior version of
        the treaty. This Treaty is being somewhat used as there isn't an
        organization that represents all of Treaty 5 but Nishnawbe Aski Nation
        (NAN) represents portions of Treaty 5 and Treaty 9. NAN's goal is to
        protect the signatories and protect the Indigenous rights, Promote
        Indigenous business and culture, and improve the quality of education
        and life in Nishnawbe Aski territory.
