      <h2>Indigenous People of Treaty 5</h2>
      <p>
        The first time people met about the treaty was on the 20th of september,
        when Alexander Morris and James Mckay met with Berens River bands at the
        Wesleyan Mission School House. There, they secured the terms of the
        treaty with little hinderence except for a small discussion on the terms
        for election of the chiefs. The commissioners would eventually discover
        that this would be brought up again later with subsequent treaty
        discussions for the next two years. The next day the commissioners moved
        north following the Nelson River. On the 24th of september they would
        meet up with two groups of Cree: Christian converts and non-Christians
        both a part of the Wood band. after talks and translations of the terms
        of the treaty it was signed. Morris and Mckay informed those that wanted
        to move south to farm at Fisher River could as a reserve would be
        constructed there. while many christian bands opted in to relocate those
        of the Wood band chose to stay behind at their home in Cross Lake, they
        would agree upon another reserve be made.
